# Build Report for a Sol'ex Spectroheliograph
by Jens Scheidtmann

## Introduction
Christian Buit created a Do-It-Yourself 3D-print spectroheliograph, see its presentation and build instructions here:
http://www.astrosurf.com/solex/sol-ex-presentation-en.html. 

This build-log reports on my attempt at building it in the form of a diary. I hope this will be useful for others, so that my 
experience will help others.

## Building the Sol'ex

### 2022-01-12
The Shelyak kit arrived: Got the lenses, the diffraction grating, the slit and additional items for building a Star'ex. 
This is the [kit from Shelyak](https://www.shelyak.com/produit/es0027-solex-and-starex-optical-kit/?lang=en).

M3 and M4 Screws are on the way. I ordered sets of M3 and M4 screws from 4 mm length up to 40 mm length and some additional washers. 
Mold insert nuts are M3 and M4 from Ruthex. Unfortunately you don't find a bill of material on the original site.   

Hopefully one roll of PETG
[black filament from dasfilament](https://www.dasfilament.de/filament-spulen/petg-1-75-mm/158/petg-filament-1-75-mm-schwarz?c=21) 
is enough.

### 2022-01-14
Ordered two helical ZWO focusers and a T2-1.25" adapter.

### 2022-01-16
Conducted first prints with the PETG filament on a Flashforge Finder. The PETG is much more prone to warping, i.e. a raft and 
glue is mandatory. Hopefully I can print the large spectrometre body parts with-out too much warping.

These are the settings I used in FlashPrint 5.2.1: 
 - Extruder Temp: 230°C
 - Shells: 3
 - Infill: 60%
 - Infull-Type: Hexagons
 - Activate Raft: Yes  (used the other default settings) 

Today's printed parts (as given in [this picture](http://www.astrosurf.com/solex/images/image-collee-701-1.webp)):
 - Support fente #2
 - Interface tel. #1 (My T2-1.25" adapter fits snuggly, even on the first warped print)
 - Bague collimateur #5
 - Bague objective #11
 - Bague épaisseur #13
 - Raidisseur #14

We will see, if I need to reprint the rings as they have a little bit of warping.
